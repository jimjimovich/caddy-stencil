## Caddy Stencil

Stencil is a templating middleware for Caddy server. It can be used with static files or combined or other middlewares (for example, proxy) to insert HTML, JSON, or HTML with JSON front matter into a pre-defined template.

Stencil is based on the Markdown plugin for Caddy but plans to focus on the integration of backend services and APIs and does not process Markdown.

**Stencil is currently NOT stable and not recommended for use in production!**
